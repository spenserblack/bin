Archived in favor of a [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/spenserblack/dotfiles).

These are just small convenience scripts that I put in `$HOME/bin`
(most of them should probably be bash functions instead).

If you stumble on this repo and like some of the scripts, but don't want to
install all of them, I just wrote a 
[GitHub CLI extension](https://github.com/spenserblack/gh-curl)
for downloading individual files. You'll need to set the file mode
(`chmod +x script`) if you download individually instead of cloning, though.
