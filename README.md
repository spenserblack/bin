These are just small convenience scripts that I put in `$HOME/bin`
(some of them could probably be aliases instead).

If you stumble on this repo and like any of the scripts, I
just wrote a [GitHub CLI extension](https://github.com/spenserblack/gh-curl)
for downloading individual files. You'll need to set the file mode
(`chmod +x script`) if you download individually instead of cloning, though.
